                <p class="p-mid">Around the world, too many children still start life at a disadvantage simply because of who they are and where they are from. A perfect storm of COVID-19, conflict and the climate crisis has left children vulnerable to critical levels of hunger and poverty. They are facing the worst global food crisis in decades. We are gravely concerned for children around the world caught in the middle of armed conflict in countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine. Their right to survival, protection and education is under immediate threat.</p>
                <p class="p-mid" id="p2-mid">But, we can do something about it. Help us protect children to ensure they not only survive but thrive.</p>

                    Shocking numbers of children are dying from illnesses that are entirely preventable, most of them in the first years of life. Every year, 5 million children under the age of five die from preventable causes.

                    Everything we do is guided by the firm belief that no child should grow up alone. Sadly, an estimated 1 in 10 children worldwide grows up without the loving care they need.

                    Millions of children are being robbed of an education simply because of who they are or where they live. Deprived of learning because they are caught up in emergencies, face extreme poverty, or are discriminated against because of their gender, disability or ethnicity. The world's most vulnerable and excluded children are missing out on education.
