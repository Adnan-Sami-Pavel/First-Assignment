                <p id="p-mid">Around the world, too many children still start life at a disadvantage simply because of who they are and where they are from. A perfect storm of COVID-19, conflict and the climate crisis has left children vulnerable to critical levels of hunger and poverty. They are facing the worst global food crisis in decades. We are gravely concerned for children around the world caught in the middle of armed conflict in countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine. Their right to survival, protection and education is under immediate threat.</p>
                <p id="p2-mid">But, we can do something about it. Help us protect children to ensure they not only survive but thrive.</p>
